## HOW IT IS NOW

- More than 80% of Swiss Population are hearing Radio daily! Yeay!
- While assistants are flooding our homes: Google Home, Alexa, Homepod... the most modern invention in Radio technology has been DAB+ which is stemming from 1987.

## PROBLEM 1 Declining audience: People are listening less and less radio

## PROBLEM 2 Fragmentation of excellent content. Little re-use.

## PROBLEM 3 "Alexa spiel mir die letzte Espresso Sendung"

## IDEA: Heidi

1. Knows all the DRS content ("Heidi spiel mir die letzte Espresso Sendung")
2. Personalized to you ("Heidi spiel meinen Lieblingssender!")
3. Allows for easy access of excessive content. Also binge-hearing.
3. Made out of wood :)

## The benefits are:

1. Ubiquitous integration of DRS content into smart homes.
2. Overcoming of program fragmentation.
3. Quality content without ads at your command.
4. Learn users preferences, offer a virtual personalized radio.
5. Move radio even "closer" to the listener.

## EVALUATION

- Good
 - It works! The technology is ready!
 - You don't need to send your data to the NSA.
- Bad
 - I already listen to radio on my mobile. I guess thats fine.
 - Yet the best speech recognition solutions are in the hands of the giants.
 - Another device in my home? No!

## FINAL THOUGHTS

- Controlling the device has a lot of benefits (e.g. Alexa, but also Swisscom Box, UPC box, etc..): You control the data, the insights, lock out competition, etc..
- Producing a market ready device never was the job of a Radio or TV station, but then times are changing ...
- You could just develop a "skill" for Alexa that works too, actually you have already (e.g. SRF sport flash)
