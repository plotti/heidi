## HOW IT IS NOW

- More than 80% of Swiss Population are hearing Radio daily! Yeay!
- While assistants are flooding our homes: Google Home, Alexa, Homepod... the most modern Invention in Radio Technology has been DAB+ which is stemming from 1987.

## PROBLEM
![Audience](https://i.imgur.com/QLw1O2r.png)

1. Declining audience: People are not listening in a streaming mode that much anymore
2. Fragmentation of excellent content which is hard to be found.
3. Alexa and Homepod don't know DRS content: "Alex spiel mir die letzte Espresso Sendung"

#HSLIDE
## IDEA: Heidi


1. Knows all the DRS content ("Heidi spiel SRF1")
2. Personalized to you ("Heidi spiel meine Lieblingssendung!")
3. Made out of wood :)

#HSLIDE
## The benefits are:

1. Ubiquitous integration of DRS content into smart homes
2. Overcoming of program fragmentation through natural interaction
3. Quality content without ads at your command.
4. Learn users preferences, since you control the device.
5. Move radio even "closer" to the listener.

## EVALUATION

- Good
 - It works! The technology is ready!
 - You don't need to send your data to the NSA.
- Bad
 - I already listen to radio on my mobile. I guess thats fine.
 - Yet the best speech recognition solutions are in the hands of the giants.
 - Another device in my home? No!

#HSLIDE
## FINAL THOUGHTS

- Controlling the device has a lot of benefits (e.g. Alexa, but also Swisscom Box, UPC box, etc..): You control the data, the insights, lock out competition, etc..
- Producing a market ready device never was the job of a Radio or TV station, but then times are changing ...
